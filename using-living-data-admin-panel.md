## Import Participants

The system is designed to run independently of any other participant system, so participants need to be imported before any deployment begins.

1. [ ] Import participants using a CSV file with the following headings: 
2. id - student identifier, or number. This must match the id imported into Intake24.
3. firstname
4. lastname
5. email - email of participant so that we can send them password reset and introduction emails.
6. group - some kind of identifier for the deployment group they are part of, can be anything as long as participants in the same group have the same value.
7. collect - Collection time for this group \(i.e. the time at which the device should start recording data\)
8. [ ] Import participants into Intake24
9. [ ] Export participant login links from Intake24
10. [ ] Upload login links to Living Data

return - Return time for this group \(i.e. the time at which the device should stop recording data\).
