# Device Management

> Device management is centered around **deployment groups**, which represent specific weekly cycles of collection and return of devices.

## Workflow Setup

You should setup a workflow of multiple docks in a 'production line' style workflow.

You should maintain the following boxes of devices:

* Devices that are clear and ready to be used for deployment
* Devices which have unknown problems and have failed for any reason during setup.
* A box for each of the up-coming deployment groups that will be collected, which will include a range of envelopes with/without devices in them.

## Distribution of Devices \(collection by participants\)

## Collection of Devices \(return by participants\)
