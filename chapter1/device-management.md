# Device Management

> Device management is centered around **deployment groups**, which represent specific weekly cycles of collection and return of devices.

## Workflow Setup

You should setup a workflow of multiple docks in a 'production line' style workflow.

You should maintain the following boxes of devices:

* Devices with data on waiting to sync.
* Devices that are clear and ready to be used for deployment
* Devices which have unknown problems and have failed for any reason during setup.
* A box for each of the up-coming deployment groups that will be collected, which will include a range of envelopes with/without devices in them.
* A box of devices which were ready to be collected but were not collected at the appropriate time.

## Preparation of Devices

At some point before each collection session, do the following:

1. Print out the 'box labels' from the admin panel and attach to the front of an empty box.
2. Print out 'registration list' PDF from the admin panel for this deployment group.
3. Fold each one in half and place into an EMPTY envelope and place in the box.

Once complete, follow this procedure:

1. Take an ENVELOPE and scan into a dock \(through the window in the envelope.
2. \(optional\) place a device from the 'ready to be deployed' bucket onto the dock, or use on already on the dock.
3. If a device is available on the dock, it will flash after a short period. If no device is available, use another dock or wait.
4. Remove this device, then scan the DEVICE.
5. Place this device into a wristband and then place in the envelope.
6. Place the envelope in the box.

Repeat until all envelopes have bands in them.

**Finally, print out the collection sign-out sheet for this group and place in the box.**

## Distribution of Devices \(collection by participants\)

Take the box of envelopes and sign-out sheet to the distribution point.

For each participant, locate their envelope and get a signature against the sheet to confirm receipt of the device.

Envelopes left at the end return to the box of un-collected devices.

## Collection of Devices \(return by participants\)

Print out the sign-in sheet for deployment group.

For each participant, retrieve their device and get them to sign confirmation of returning it.

Return all devices to the 'awaiting sync' box.

**Devices that were previously in the 'awaiting collection' box for this group should be included into the box waiting to sync.**

> At some point \(1 day\) after the group has been collected, use the Admin interface to list devices that are still with participants and send reminder emails.

## Uploading Data

Devices in the 'awaiting sync' box should be placed onto ANY dock. When placed on the dock it will upload and wipe the device.

Devices which are fully charged can be removed and placed in the 'ready to program' box to make room for more devices that need to be uploaded.
